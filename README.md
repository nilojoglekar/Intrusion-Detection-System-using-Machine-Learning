# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Machine-Learning
Created an Advanced Intrusion detection System that uses decision trees and supervised learning to that predicts attacks to the system with a 98% accuracy.
The Proposed network intrusion detection system can classify packets in real-time based on the packets collected from the network flow
